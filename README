This is a basic quest game written in Ruby with Sinatra, and given a deliberately retro look. The object is to collect gems, avoid the grue, and reach the goal alive once you collect five gems (six, if you include the freebie). Since this is basically a demo, locations for the grue and gems are given on each turn, so you may actively try to avoid or intercept it instead of running around blind. These settings can be turned off using the form on the right. You can also switch between template systems, though there's not much of a visual difference, there (the ERB templates use the original stylesheet, while the others use the Sass-ified one).

To do: Tweak the UI some more (maybe find a more eye-cancerous shade of chartreuse), and maybe set up a form to allow users to upload map files, or something. If I'm feeling really ambitious, I'll read up on actual pathing algorithms and try to use one, especially since the recent versions of the RubyTree gem break the app.
