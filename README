This is a basic quest game written in Ruby, and given a retro look. The object is to collect gems, avoid the grue, and reach the goal alive once you collect five gems. Since this is basically a demo, the grue's location and path are given on each turn, so you may try to avoid or intercept it.

To do: Tweak the UI some more (maybe find a more eye-cancerous shade of chartreuse), and get the info sidebar to work--it should update on every move, whereas right now it does, y'know, nothing. Also, set up a form to change the settings, or allow users to upload settings in a json file, or something.
